//! # rcrypt: A compact hashing and salting library based on bcrypt with smaller hashes
//!
//! `rcrypt`, short for "reduced crypt" is a more compact alternative to bcrypt,
//! generating **hashes that are 33.3% smaller** (40 bytes vs 60 bytes) than bcrypt.
//!
//! To achieve this, rcrypt merges fields of the hash and encodes the salt+digest into binary,
//! in accordance with the [BMCF specification](https://github.com/ademarre/binary-mcf).
//! Read [more here](https://github.com/ohsayan/rcrypt#how-it-works).
//!
//! This is a very simple example that you can use for conveniently hashing and
//! salting passwords:
//! ```
//! let password = String::from("pass123");
//!	let hash = rcrypt::hash(&password, rcrypt::DEFAULT_COST).unwrap();
//!	assert!(rcrypt::verify(&password, &hash).unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Migrating from bcrypt
//!
//! To migrate from bcrypt, simply keep this in mind: the returned hash is a [`Vec<u8>`]
//! instead of a [`String`], since `rcrypt` returns hashes with binary data.
//! Similary, to verify a hash, you'll have to pass the password as usual but the hash
//! passed must be a `&[u8]`, corresponding to the binary hash that rcrypt generates.
//!
//! The rest remains unchanged.
//!

/// The default hash cost
pub const DEFAULT_COST: u32 = 12;
pub use crate::error::{RcryptError, RcryptResult};

/// which cost to use, use the [`DEFAULT_COST`]. The OS randomness is used to
